# PixabayApi
## Sample application on pixabay Api:thumbsup:.
I have Used AsyncTask for fetching the data.
And also used recyclerview for displaying all the images which is the advanced technology for list view.
Picasso is the third party library, used for displaying image.
Get the Api key from the browser.
A search bar is plased to search the  image you want.
